## Language Detection

The goal of this project is to create and train a neural network that detects the differences between the English, Spanish, German, French and Italian languages. Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks need to identify which language their input text is in order to move forward and complete any remaining tasks with the text data. Businesses can take advantage of language detection models to break the language barrier between countries as well as connect with more people all around the world.
