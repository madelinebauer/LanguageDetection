## Language Detection

The goal of this analysis is to create and train a model to detect the difference between the English, Spanish, German, French and Italian languages and then when given some new text, it will be able to correctly predict the language it is in. NLP projects need to identify which language their input text is in order to move forward and complete any remaining tasks. Businesses can take advantage of language detection models to break the language barrier between countries as well as connect with more people all around the world.
